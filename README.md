# havoc-launcher
This is my attempt at making a simple launcher for Fortnite. 
The code is kinda messy, hope to rewrite it in the future.

Tested with s1-s14

*Note: You need a backend running to be able to login to Fortnite*

## TODO
- Fix Console and Memory Leak Injection
- Start as server option
- Bundle LawinServer

## Acknowledgements
